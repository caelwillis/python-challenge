Module 3 Challenge

PyBank:
After importing os and csv, the first step in our code is for Python to open and read the budget data CSV file provided in our Resources folder.

We then will want to calculate the length of the file past the header, which will give us the total number of months in our data. Next we want to set up an 'if' statement that allows our code to calculate the change in value between each line in our data.

We can then manupulate that data to tell us the average change, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.

All of that data is then written onto the 'budget.rft' Text File to give the final results of our financial analysis.



PyPoll:
We begin to tackle the PyPoll problem in the same way we did for our budget problem, first we import os and csv before instruction Python to open and read our election data.

We then define our values starting our total number of votes at 0 and create empty lists for the name of each candiate and the number of votes to populate. We then set up a For loop which will scan though each row and record what candidate receives a vote.

The results are printed to the 'election.rft' Text File to give our final election analysis.
